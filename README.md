# Machine-Learning-Enhanced-Intrusion-Detection-For-Cybersecurity
Built using Machine Learning 


## Overview
The Intrusion Detection Model helps to identify the network traffic and distinguish whether the activity of the network is normal or abnormal. It detects and provide solution even when it is zero day attack. The project development process involves various step including collecting a raw dataset , preprocessing the data into structured format, data visualization is done for analysis of attack type and to find the accuracy of attacks, implemented and trained the model with three different algorithm - GNB, Adabooster, Extratree classifier to classify and to find the greater accuracy of attacks.The accuracy dataset is stored in pkl format. Later a webpage is developed for user interaction, to find what type of attack is detected and how to prevent it and precautions will be provided for user.

## Technologies Used
- **Tools:** Django, Anaconda Navigator, vscode .
